# Starter template view

There is a starter repo for a vue markwhen view that you can use to scaffold your own visualization: [mark-when/vue-view-template](https://github.com/mark-when/vue-view-template) (it is only nominally `vue`-specific, if you prefer react or some other framework you will have no problems understanding what's going on).

To use this repo, start by cloning it, installing dependencies, and running the dev server:

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:mark-when/vue-view-template.git
> cd vue-view-template
> npm i
> npm run dev
```

Then clone and run the [hosting app](https://github.com/mark-when/markwhen) or go to [markwhen.com](https://markwhen.com) and add the new view:

![](/images/settings2.png)
![](/images/dialog.png)
![](/images/added.png)

<hr>

If everything has been set up successfully, you should see a new visualization that spits out the entire parser output:
