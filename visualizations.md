# Visualizations

Markwhen and markwhen.com are built to be extensible, primarily in that it does not assume what kind of visualization will be used from the parsed text.

If you are interested in making your own visualizations and would like help/input/more documentation, reach out to me either at rob@markwhen.com or @rob__koch on twitter. It is on my todo list regardless; just haven't gotten to it yet.

Both the calendar and map views are built in this extensible way and are hosted on their own domains.
