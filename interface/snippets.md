# Snippets

Snippets allow you to define autocompletions that active as you type. A `prefix` is the text that you type to trigger the snippet, and the `template` is the text that gets inserted replacing the prefix.

For example, you may find typing `check` easier than `- [] ` - you can define a snippet that will make that replacement:

![](/images/snippets2.png)
![](/images/snippets6.png)
![](/images/snippets4.png)
![](/images/snippets7.png)

`${}` are cursor positions after the replacement has been made. Read more about snippets and their syntax [here](https://codemirror.net/docs/ref/#autocomplete.snippet).
