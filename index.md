# Markwhen

Markwhen is a markdown-like journal language. You write markdown-ish text and it gets converted into a nice looking cascading timeline or other [view](/visualizations).

Use the editor at [meridiem.markwhen.com](https://meridiem.markwhen.com).

[View example timeline that uses all of markwhen's features](https://meridiem.markwhen.com/example).
