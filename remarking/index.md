# Remarking

Remarking is a twitter-like blogging site. You write markwhen and each entry is its own "remark".

Remarking is built on top of [Meridiem](/meridiem) and the [OAuth API](/meridiem/api) and uses markwhen documents stored in Meridiem. In this way you can edit your markwhen documents directly via Meridiem, or you can use the Remarking interface.
