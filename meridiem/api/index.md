# Meridiem Apps

Meridiem supports apps that act on a user's behalf via the [OAuth API](/meridiem/api/).

To create an app, ensure that you are signed into Meridiem. Go to `Settings` -> `Developer` -> Under `Apps`, click `Create`.
Enter your app's information (it can be changed later) and click `Save`.

Your app's `app_id` and `app_secret` will be generated, and there will be additional fields to add more supplemental data:

- `Optional` icon url that will display on the OAuth page
- `Optional` scope justification that will also be displayed on the OAuth page, for explaining the purpose of requesting the scopes that your app requests.
